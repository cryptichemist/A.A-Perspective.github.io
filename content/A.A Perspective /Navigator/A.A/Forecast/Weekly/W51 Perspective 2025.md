## W50 Recap

The dominant theme for last week was the [[Federal Reserve]]'s final [[FOMC]] meeting of 2025.

* **Rate Decision:** Policymakers delivered a widely anticipated **25 basis point rate cut**, bringing the [[Federal Funds Rate]] down for the 3rd time this year.
* **The Rationale:** Fed Chair [[Jerome Powell]] justified the move by citing downside risks to the [[Labor Market]].

> [!info] Key Economic Data
> * **Job Openings:** The data released showed unexpectedly that [[JOLTS|job openings]] rose to a 5-month high in October. This data had been withheld until now due to the [[Government Shutdown]].
> * **Jobless Claims:** [[Initial Jobless Claims]] for the week ending Dec 6th jumped significantly, indicating mixed and fragile labor conditions.

### Market Reaction

* **Policy Outlook:** While the policy statement was slightly more guarded regarding the *pace* of future cuts, investors focused on the overall easing bias and the Fed's higher 2026 [[GDP]] forecasts.
* **Bonds:** In the [[Bond Market]], short-term [[Treasury Yields]] fell after the cut. However, rising longer-term yields caused the [[Yield Curve]] to steepen, suggesting that investors are pricing in improving growth expectations alongside continued policy normalization.
* **Currencies:** With the [[DXY]] notably showing strength going into 2026, perhaps we are going to see more pivotal price action in our beloved [[Safe Haven Asset]]. Hedging against the dollar is seeming less and less appealing.

## The Finale: W51 Outlook

**Week 51** represents the final true trading week of 2025, and it is shaping up to be a "clearing house" event for the global markets.

We are moving from a period of information scarcity since we started seeing the release of delayed data last week. Institutional desks will likely be waiting on the rest of the backlogged data before clearing up shop for the holidays.

I am expecting some interesting price action earlier this week before everyone puts the charts away for Christmas. [[BTC]] had more volume this weekend than usual and I think that says a lot about overall sentiment.

The US government releases its backlog of delayed economic reports, including a double release of **Non-Farm Payrolls** (for both October and November) on Tuesday, which will most likely be the most volatile day of the week.

**It's Central Bank week!** With the [[BOJ]], the [[BOE]], and the [[ECB]] all delivering their final rate decisions of the year.

> [!tip] Trading Perspective
> Much of this week's price action will be driven by funds closing positions and digesting the delayed data. Stay nimble.
