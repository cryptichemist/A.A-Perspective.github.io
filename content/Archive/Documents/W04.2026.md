title: "Week 4: WEF aftermath"
---
Precious Metals are trading at unprecedented highs following the 2026 [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos. The proceedings were dominated by a shift from global cooperation toward **confrontational geoeconomics**. While the agenda spanned AI and Climate Action, the gravity of the event remained centered on the United States and the Trump administration's "21st-century version of American power."

## Economic Forecast:

The markets are currently in a holding pattern. Most institutions are grappling with Davos data and the tension between a US-led recovery and the continued push for a **De-Dollarized environment** as we move into February.

- **Wednesday 28th Jan:** USD - [[Federal Funds Rate]], [[FOMC]] Statement, and Press Conference.
    
    - _Analysis:_ Forecast is neutral. I would be surprised to see another cut; a hike at this stage would be disheartening for the US economy and likely trigger a bleaker sentiment in domestic markets.
        
- **Thursday 29th Jan:** USD - [[Unemployment Claims]].
    
    - _Analysis:_ Forecasted to rise. If the actual print is lower than **200k**, expect the dollar to regain some footing following the post-WEF crash in the DXY.
        
- **Friday 30th Jan:** USD - FOMC members speak on monetary policy; delayed [[Core PPI]] data is released.

## WEF Aftermath: Contrasting Perspectives.

The most influential moments of the convention were the addresses by **Donald Trump** and **Mark Carney**. Their approaches offered a stark contrast in how nations should navigate a fractured world.

### 1. The American Fortress (Donald Trump)

Trump articulated a vision of the "fastest and most dramatic economic turnaround in history," using the stock market as his primary scoreboard.

- **Economic Indicators:** He cited 52 all-time highs within the year, claiming 9 trillion added to American savings and 18 trillion in new domestic investment commitments.
    
- **The "Working Class" Pivot:** He leaned heavily on the July tax legislation, specifically the elimination of federal taxes on **tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits**.
    
- **Energy & Deregulation:** Trump reaffirmed "American Energy Dominance," announcing a significant new energy cooperation deal with **Venezuela**. He explicitly dismissed international green initiatives as the "Green New Scam," favoring "clean" fossil fuels and modular nuclear reactors over "visually destructive" wind energy.
    

### 2. The Strategic Acquisition of Greenland

Trump formally announced intentions to negotiate the acquisition of Greenland from Denmark, framing it as a **vital national security priority**. Based on its strategic location rather than the resources. 

> "If a war was to be fought, it would be physically over that region... Missiles would be flying over from both sides."

To counter this, he proposed the **"Golden Dome"**—a missile defense system designed to protect all of North America from aerial attack.

### 3. Value-Based Realism (Mark Carney)

Canadian PM Mark Carney presented a strategy for "Middle Powers" to survive the collapse of the old international order.

- **The Rupture:** Using the allegory of Václav Havel’s "green grocer," Carney argued that nations must stop performing the rituals of a "rules-based order" that no longer exists. He declared it is time to "take the signs down" and acknowledge that integration is now being used as a weapon through tariffs and supply chain coercion.
    
- **Strategic Autonomy:** Carney’s Canada is fast-tracking 1 trillion in domestic investments (Energy, AI, Critical Minerals) while doubling defense spending by 2030.
    
- **The [[Board of Peace]]:** Carney confirmed Canada’s willingness to join Trump’s proposed "Board of Peace" for Gaza, provided there is a clear path to a two-state solution and structured humanitarian aid.

## Conclusion

Last week was a massive window for nations to be heard—and held accountable. While a tentative agreement was reached regarding Greenland, it would be bold to assume this ends the friction within NATO. We are gradually moving toward a new system. One clear takeaway theme from Davos, was the fact that the world **is** integrated with the dollar currently, it would be a complex process to change that despite talks.

I want to go into the wider situation and environment in greater detail. Regarding Iran the situation is still stagnant with the US stalling but greatly increasing its military presence in the region. This is a ongoing narrative that will need a more analytical approach.
