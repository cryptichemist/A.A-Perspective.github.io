# Week 3 Report: 

These first few weeks of 2026 will likely go down in history as the beginnings of a new world order and operating system. In my recent weekly reports and my January overview, we covered how the USA is projecting a new global approach of nationalism and acquisition of resources—from restructuring deals in Africa to aggression towards Iran and "liberating" crude oil in Venezuela via forced regime change.

Now, as of week 2, the Trump administration has directed its focus to the High North and Greenland. This holds exceptional importance for the global trade system. Despite Greenland being an American ally and a member of NATO through Denmark, the USA has made it clear that its acquisition holds high importance for "National Security." I will unpack this in greater detail in the Consensus section of this report.

## Consensus

> [!IMPORTANT] Week 2 was highlighted by fears of US intervention in Iran which did not take place, likely due to Israeli and Saudi officials fearing Iranian retaliation targeted at them if the Trump administration made a military move against the regime.

On top of this, there are reports that Iran successfully tested its first [[ICBM]] (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile). Despite these claims, US aircraft carriers are approaching the region and nearby US military bases have been evacuated. The European Union encouraged airlines to still avoid Iranian airspace since it reopened last week.

### The Arctic Front: The Greenland Acquisition

More importantly is the increasing friction between the USA and NATO over Greenland. Early last week, leading NATO members sent just under 50 troops to Greenland; for comparison, the UK sent 1 soldier and Germany sent 12. Denmark has also sent forces, though the number remains unknown.

In response, the Trump administration announced a **10% tariff on all imports** from countries currently backing Greenland's sovereignty with Denmark. This tariff will increase **to 25%** in June if no "Deal" is met.

**The Resource Play:** This isn't just about territory and trade routes; it's a strategic move for **Rare Earth Elements (REEs)** and Uranium. Greenland holds some of the world's largest undeveloped deposits, essential for the US to decouple its tech and defense industry from Chinese supply chains.

Poll with US citizens on opposition or support of action in Greenland.


European Union lawmakers are poised to halt approval of the EU's trade deal with the US. 
Manfred Weber, president of the European People's Party, stated on Saturday that "Agreement with the US is no longer possible."

### NATO Treaty & Legal Conflict

By signed treaty, NATO countries are obliged to come to the defense of any other NATO country attacked. They are technically obliged to protect Greenland from an invasion by the US.

However, the US points to the **1951 Defense Treaty** with Denmark, which already grants the US extensive military rights on the island (specifically the Thule/Pituffik Space Base). The administration's argument is that "National Security" necessitates expanding these military rights into full territorial sovereignty.

The irony is that if Trump didn't have such an aggressive approach, Greenland was already on the verge of breaking away from Denmark.

### The Canada-China Pivot

Canada has pledged their efforts to deter any invasion of Greenland and **ensured** that they stand behind [[Article 5]]. This furthers the western divide that Trump is trying to mend by force. If Canada and the US end up in conflict offshore, it would be detrimental to the functioning of the Americas.
Most significantly, **Canada is turning to China as a new ally this week** to counter US pressure. This puts the [[USMCA]] (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) in immediate jeopardy.

### The Easy Way or the Hard Way

"I would like to make a deal, you know, the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way," Trump told reporters on Friday. When asked if he was considering a financial offer to the people of the island, he said he was "not talking about money for Greenland yet... but right now, we are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not."

**Trump's Greenland Grab Triggers Incredulity.** Europe is currently paralyzed. Not only do officials have no set strategy to address Trump's threats, they concede they don't understand what he wants or how to improve things. Yet they know they still need US support, despite the once-steady ally growing increasingly hostile. Even if the USA backs off, the willingness to use military threats against long-standing allies reveals a painful new reality, raising ominous parallels with the previous world war.

Greenland's lawmakers tell Trump no amount of money can buy Greenland. "It's disrespectful to think you can buy a people. What use is a one-off payment when your entire foundation is being torn away?"

## Conclusion: Generational Pivot.

All of these geopolitical shifts draw a fine line between two distinct futures for the global financial operating system.

### Scenario A: The Resource-Backed Hegemon

In this future, the US Dollar does not only retain its position as the Global Reserve but increases its dominance dramatically. By securing Greenland, the United States transforms the island into a triple-threat asset:

- **The New Trade Nexus:** Control over the melting Northwest Passage shipping routes.
    
- **Mineral Sovereignty:** Ownership of the world’s largest untapped Rare Earth Element (REE) deposits, ending Western reliance on Chinese supply chains.
    
- **The Digital Utopia:** Greenland becomes the world’s premier hub for high-density AI data centers. Its natural Arctic cooling allows for the massive "compute" power required in 2026, creating a **"Data-for-Dollar" settlement system** where global AI processing is priced exclusively in USD.

### Scenario B: The Great Fragmentation

Alternatively, the wider world retaliates against "acquisition-based" diplomacy. In this scenario, nations continue boycotting the Dollar, turning instead to central bank accumulation of precious metals and new alignments.

- **The Carney-Xi Pivot:** Canada’s recent alignment with China signals the end of a unified North American front. By bypassing the Dollar via the **mBridge** network and new bilateral trade deals, these nations create a "Dollar-Free Zone."
    
- **The Rise of the [[UBCD]]:** The volatility of a weaponized Dollar triggers the release of a **Universal Bank Digital Currency (UBCD)**. Unlike the Dollar, this would likely be a commodity-backed digital asset—anchored by a basket of Gold, Silver, and Arctic minerals—offering the stability and neutrality that the current system lacks.



> [!QUOTE] **The Bottom Line** While this restructuring of the financial system is inevitable, it depends entirely on the outcomes of the current climate. It could be that the United States becomes the "one true global superpower" and issues its own UBCD to cement control, but the current aggression suggests this path comes at a severe risk to national and alliance stability.
> 
> If the reward of Arctic dominance outweighs the risk of global retaliation, the Dollar will retain its crown. One thing is certain: **this is a generational play.** We are witnessing the "hard reset" of the world order, and only those who are prepared for the cascade of shifts on the horizon will come out on top
